## ðŸš€ Project Structure

This project uses [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) to create a documentation site. The project structure is as follows:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ usage/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reference/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Inside docs, there are the index, including-it and getting-started pages. These are introductory pages.

The usage folder contains more to the point documentation. Basically the README.md file, but in a more structured way.

The reference folder contains the API reference for the project. This is where you can find all the details about the project.
