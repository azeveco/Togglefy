Togglefy adds two essential models/tables to deal with feature toggle. The tables were added to the database when the migrations were ran [here](../../getting-started/#running-the-migrations).

## Togglefy::Feature

The first model is called `Togglefy::Feature`.

It's the model that will have all the features of your application.

### Structure

```ruby
id: integer
name: string, null: false
identifier: string
description: string
group: string
environment: string
tenant_id: string
status: integer
created_at: datetime
updated_at: datetime
```

### Associations

The `Togglefy::Feature` has the following associations:

```ruby
has_many :feature_assignments, dependent: :destroy
has_many :assignables, through: :feature_assignments, source: :assignable
```

### Scopes

Scopes here are defined to query `Togglefy::Features`.

We won't explain much here, as this is covered inside the `FeatureQuery` section of the documentation.

```ruby
scope :identifier # Finds features by their identifier
scope :for_group # Finds features by their group
scope :without_group # Finds features with group == nil
scope :for_environment # Finds features by their environment
scope :without_environment # Finds features with environment == nil
scope :for_tenant # Finds features by their tenant_id
scope :without_tenant # Finds features with tenant_id == nil
scope :inactive # Finds features by inactive status
scope :active # Finds features by active status
scope :with_status # Finds features by status
```


### Building identifier

The `identifier` is a string, which is built if not sent. It must be snake_case.

```ruby
def build_identifier
  self.identifier = name.underscore.parameterize(separator: "_")
end
```

### Status

As you can see, the `Togglefy::Feature` also has a status and it is default to `inactive`. You can change this during creation.

The status of a `Togglefy::Feature` should not be interpreted as if the Assignable has the feature.

The status holds the `inactive` or `active` values. This status is not to define if an Assignable (any model that has the `include Togglefy::Assignable`) either has or doesn't have a feature, but to decide if this feature is available system/application-wide.

It's up to you to define how you will implement it:
* Is it inactive? Then this feature is likely unreleased
* Or maybe if it is inactive, it means that the feature is unavailable for some reason? Maintenance? 

Again, it's up to you!

The `status` can be:

```ruby
:inactive || "inactive" || 0
:active || "active" || 1
```

## Togglefy::FeatureAssignment

The `Togglefy::FeatureAssignment` model holds the relation between the `Togglefy::Feature` and the `Assignable`.

It's there to specify if an `Assignable` has a feature or not. If it does, then it has a `Togglefy::FeatureAssignment` record that holds the `Assignable` ID and the feature ID.

### Structure

```ruby
feature_id: integer, null: false
assignable_id: depends, null: false
assignable_type: string, null: false
created_at: datetime, null: false
updated_at: datetime, null: false
```

### Associations

The `Togglefy::FeatureAssignment` has the following associations:

```ruby
belongs_to :feature, class_name: "Togglefy::Feature"
belongs_to :assignable, polymorphic: true
```

As you can see, the `assignable` is `polymorphic`, which means you can make multiple models hold the `Togglefy::Assignable`:

```ruby
include Togglefy::Assignable
```

This way, a `User` can have many features, an `Account`, a `Party`, a `Subscription` and so on.

### Scopes

Only one, to list all `Togglefy::FeatureAssignment` by `Assignable` class.

```ruby
scope :for_type
```

## Togglefy::Assignable

Not a model per se, but a `ActiveSupport::Concern`. You include it inside the models and that's why we're here.

The `Togglefy::Assignable` is what will setup the essentials between `Togglefy::Feature` and `Togglefy::FeatureAssignment`.

This is what turns a model into an `Assignable`.

### Include

As mentioned multiple times before, you turn something into an `Assignable` by including this inside the model:

```ruby
include Togglefy::Assignable
```

### Associations

The `Togglefy::Assignable` has the following associations:

```ruby
has_many :feature_assignments, as: :assignable, class_name: "Togglefy::FeatureAssignment"
has_many :features, through: :feature_assignments, class_name: "Togglefy::Feature"
```

As you can see, an `Assignable` has many features. That's essential to us. That's the root of everything.

### Scopes

There's also a few scopes that help us achieve greatness, like:

```ruby
scope :with_features # Retrieve assignables with specific features
scope :without_features # Retrieve assignables without specific features
```

### Methods

Here are defined methods to manage the relation between `Assignable` and `Togglefy::Feature`. We won't explain much here, as this is covered inside the `FeatureManager` section of the documentation.

```ruby
def feature?(identifier); end
def add_feature(feature); end
def remove_feature(feature); end
def clear_features; end
```
