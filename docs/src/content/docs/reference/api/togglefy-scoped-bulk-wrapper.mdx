description: About the ScopedBulkWrapper, the module responsible for mass/bulk operations
---

The `Togglefy::ScopedBulkWrapper` module serve as a wrapper for mass/bulk operations.

Inside it, there's only `Togglefy::BulkToggler` class so far, which is responsible for enabling or disabling features to many Assignable objects at once. It provides a convenient way to perform these operations without the need for individual updates.

:::note
For the methods here, you need to initialize the Assignable class before you can actually call the methods.

## Methods

### mass_for

**Description**

---

The `Togglefy::ScopedBulkWrapper` class, to make use of mass/bulk operations.

**Parameters**

---

```ruby
assignable: Assignable # Required
```

**Usage Examples**

---

```ruby
Togglefy.mass_for(Assignable)

# Let's assume the assignable is a User class.
Togglefy.mass_for(User)
```

**Return**

---

```ruby
Togglefy::ScopedBulkWrapper
```

### bulk

**Description**

---

The `bulk` method is used to create a new instance of the [`Togglefy::BulkToggler`](#togglefybulktoggler) class for a Assignable class.

After creating the instance, you can use it to enable or disable features for multiple assignable objects.

**Parameters**

---

You can only get to this method by calling [`mass_for`](#mass_for) first. Which means you already have the only parameter: `Assignable` class.

This parameter is already sent through the [`mass_for`](#mass_for) method.

**Usage Examples**

---

```ruby
# Let's assume the assignable is a User class.
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk
```

**Return**

---

```ruby
Togglefy::BulkToggler
```

## Togglefy::BulkToggler

The `Togglefy::BulkToggler` class is responsible for enabling or disabling features to many Assignable objects at once. It provides a convenient way to perform these operations without the need for individual updates.

Whenever you do a enable/disable, it will only query for valid assignables, so:
- If you do a enable, it will query all assignables that don't have the feature(s) enabled
- If you do a disable, it will query all assignables that do already have the feature(s) enabled

This class only has two methods: `enable` and `disable`.

Both methods can receive the same parameters, and they will work the same way.

The parameters are:
```ruby
identifiers: Symbol || String || Array(Symbol || String) # Required, positional argument. It should be the first parameter
group: Symbol || String # Optional
role: Symbol || String # Alias of group
environment: Symbol || String # Optional
env: Symbol || String # Alias of environment
tenant_id: String # Optional
percentage: Integer # Optional
```

:::note
This API uses keyword arguments.

You need to pass the identifier(s) of the feature(s) you want to update as a positional argument. It should be the first parameter.

After that, you can pass the parameters you want to update as keyword arguments.

You can see the usage examples on each method to get a better understanding of how to use them.
:::

The `group` and `role` parameters are aliases of each other, and the same goes for `environment` and `env`.

The `percentage` parameter is used to enable the feature for a percentage of the assignables. If sent, it will be used to calculate the percentage of assignables that will have the feature enabled/disabled.

### Methods

#### enable

**Description**

---

Enable a feature for multiple assignable objects.

**Usage Examples**

---

Pay attention that the first parameter is always the identifier(s), which is positional and required. The rest are keyword arguments.

```ruby
# To enable a specific feature to all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.enable(:super_powers)

# To enable two or more features to all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.enable([:super_powers, :magic])

# To enable a feature to 20% of all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.enable(:super_powers, percentage: 20)

# To enable two or more features to 50% of all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.enable([:super_powers, :magic], percentage: 50)
```

**Return**

---

```ruby
true || Togglefy::Error
```

#### disable

**Description**

---

Disable a feature for multiple assignable objects.

**Usage Examples**

---

Pay attention that the first parameter is always the identifier(s), which is positional and required. The rest are keyword arguments.

```ruby
# To disable a specific feature to all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.disable(:super_powers)

# To disable two or more features to all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.disable([:super_powers, :magic])

# To disable a feature to 20% of all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.disable(:super_powers, percentage: 20)

# To disable two or more features to 50% of all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.disable([:super_powers, :magic], percentage: 50)
```

**Return**

---

```ruby
true || Togglefy::Error
```
