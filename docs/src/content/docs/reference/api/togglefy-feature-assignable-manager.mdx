## Methods

### for

**Description**

---

This method is used to create a new instance of the `Togglefy::FeatureAssignableManager` class for a specific assignable.

After creating the instance, you can use it to manage and check features for that assignable.

**Parameters**

**Usage Examples**

---

Let's pretend the assignable is a user object.
```ruby
user = User.find(1)

Togglefy.for(user)
```

**Return**

---

```ruby
Togglefy::FeatureAssignableManager
```

### enable

**Description**

---

Enable a feature for an assignable.

This method will enable the feature for the assignable, regardless of the feature's status.

This is useful for testing or debugging purposes.

This method will not affect the feature's status for other assignables.

**Parameters**

```ruby
identifier: Symbol, String # Required
```

**Usage Examples**

```ruby
user = User.find(1)

Togglefy.for(user).enable(:teleportation)
```

**Return**

```ruby
Togglefy::FeatureAssignableManager
```

### disable

**Description**

---

Disable a feature for an assignable.

This method will disable the feature for the assignable, regardless of the feature's status.

This is useful for testing or debugging purposes.

This method will not affect the feature's status for other assignables.

**Parameters**

```ruby
identifier: Symbol, String # Required
```

**Usage Examples**

Togglefy.for(user).disable(:teleportation)
```

---

```ruby
Togglefy::FeatureAssignableManager
```

### has?

**Description**

---

Check if a feature is enabled for an assignable.

An assignable has a feature if there's a [`Togglefy::FeatureAssignment`](../../structure/models#togglefyfeatureassignment) record for the assignable and the feature.

**Parameters**

---

```ruby
identifier: Symbol, String # Required
```

**Usage Examples**

---

```ruby
user = User.find(1)

Togglefy.for(user).has?(:teleportation)

### Chainable Methods

The following methods are chainable, meaning you can call them one after the other.

- [`enable`](#enable)
- [`disable`](#disable)
- [`clear`](#clear)

**Usage Examples**

---

```ruby
# Instead of doing this:
Togglefy.for(assignable).disable(:alpha_access)
Togglefy.for(assignable).enable(:beta_access)

# You can go something like this:
Togglefy.for(assignable).disable(:alpha_access).enable(:beta_access)
```
