While in the Documentation section you saw the basics and usage of the gem.

In Reference you will learn everything about the internals of Togglefy:

- What are Togglefy's APIs
- What do they expect as parameters
- The complete structure of the Assignable concern and models
- and more!

Feel free to contribute to this documentation and the gem [here](https://github.com/azeveco/Togglefy).
