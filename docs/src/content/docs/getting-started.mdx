Togglefy is a simple feature management Rails gem to help you control which features an assignable has access to.

**Togglefy** is free, open source and you are welcome to help build it. Give us a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/azeveco/Togglefy) if you can!

:::caution[Attention]
Togglefy was built to be Rails/Ruby version proof and tested with both newer and older Rails (`>= 4.2.8`) and newer and older Ruby (`>= 2.4.10`).

This doesn't mean that you won't encounter problems during use if you use an older version. If you do, we'll be glad to hear from you [here](https://github.com/azeveco/Togglefy/issues) and see **if** we can do anything to help.

## Quick Start

### Installation

<Steps>

1. Add the gem manually to your `Gemfile`:

    ```ruby
    gem "togglefy", "~> 1.2"
    ```

    <Steps>
    1. You can also add it to your `Gemfile` by running:
        ```bash frame="none"
        bundle add togglefy
        ```

    2. Or, if you're not using Bundler for whatever reason:
        ```bash frame="none"
        gem install togglefy
        ```
    </Steps>

2. After that, simply run the generate command to get the necessary migrations:

    ```bash frame="none"
    rails generate togglefy:install
    ```

3. And you're good to go!

</Steps>

This `generate` command will create the migrations to create the tables inside your project.

Please, don't remove/change anything else that's there or Togglefy may not work as expected.

:::tip
Before running the migrations, make sure that the migration `CreateTogglefyFeatureAssignments` have the correct data type for the `assignable` (table/model) that you're going to use.

Example: if you use `UUID`, check if it will automatically use it. If not, specify it by doing appending a:
```diff lang="ruby"
- t.references :assignable, polymorphic: true, null: false
+ t.references :assignable, polymorphic: true, null: false, type: :uuid
```
:::

#### Running the migrations

Run the migration to create these in your database:
```bash frame="none"
rails db:migrate
```
Or if you're using a legacy codebase:
```bash frame="none"
rake db:migrate
```

The models are stored inside Togglefy, so you don't need to create them inside your project unless you want to.

If that's something you want, you can check them following this path: `app/models/togglefy/`.
