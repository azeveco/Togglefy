description: Learn how to query Features

Remember when I told you a looooong time ago that using `Togglefy` for operations is the default using by the gem? If you don't, no worries. It was a really loooong time ago, like `1.minute.ago`.

It's actually pretty simple. Each line of each code block will show you a way to query to achieve the same result in the context. You **don't** need to use all of options listed in each code block.

## Querying Features (plural)

To query `Togglefy::Feature` from a specific group (the same applies to environment and tenant), you would do something like this:

```ruby
Togglefy::Feature.where(group: :dev)
Togglefy::Feature.for_group(:dev)
Togglefy.for_group(:dev)
Togglefy.for_role(:dev)
Togglefy.for_filters(filters: {group: :dev})
Togglefy.for_filters(filter: {role: :dev})
```

The `for_filters` is recommended when you want to use more than one filter, like:

```ruby
Togglefy.for_filters(filters: {group: :admin, environment: :production})
```

This will query me all `Togglefy::Feature`s that belongs to group admin and the production environment.

The `Togglefy.for_filters` can have the following filters:

```ruby
{
  group:,
  role:, # Acts as a group, explained in the Aliases section
  environment:,
  env:, # Acts as a group, explained in the Aliases section
  tenant_id:,
  status:,
  identifier:
}
```

The `Togglefy.for_filters` will only apply the filters sent that are `nil` or `!value.blank?`.

You can send `nil` values too, like:

```ruby
Togglefy.for_tenant(nil) # This will query me all Togglefy::Features with tenant_id nil

Togglefy.for_filters(filters: {group: :admin, environment: nil, tenant_id: nil})
```

There's also another way to filter for `nil` values:

```ruby
Togglefy.without_group
Togglefy.without_role

Togglefy.without_environment
Togglefy.without_env

Togglefy.without_tenant
```

## Querying by Status

To query Togglefy::Features by status (the same applies to inactive).

```ruby
Togglefy::Feature.where(status: :active)
Togglefy::Feature.active
Togglefy.with_status(:active)
```

## Finding a specific feature

```ruby
Togglefy.feature(:super_powers)
Togglefy::Feature.identifier(:super_powers)
Togglefy::Feature.find_by(identifier: :super_powers)
```

## Finding multiple features

```ruby
Togglefy.feature([:super_powers, :magic])
Togglefy::Feature.identifier([:super_powers, :magic])
Togglefy::Feature.where(identifier: [:super_powers, :magic])
```

## List all features of an Assignable
Let's pretend that your assignable is an User.

```ruby
user = User.find(1)
user.features
```

## Check all features an Assignable have/doesn't have
Again, let's pretend that your assignable is an User. This is the only case you need to send the feature id and not the identifier.

```ruby
User.with_features(1)
User.with_features([2, 3])
User.without_features(1)
User.without_features([2, 3])
```

## Querying all features
```ruby
Togglefy.features
Togglefy::Feature.all
```

## Querying all features enabled to a klass
Let's assume that you have two different assignables: User and Account.

You want to list all features being used by assignables of User type:

```ruby
Togglefy.for_type(User) # This returns all current FeatureAssignment with a User assignable
```

## Aliases

By the way, did you notice that I wrote `group` and `role` to get group?

There are aliases for both group and environment that can be used outside of `Togglefy::Feature`. If you want to query `Togglefy::Feature` directly, use only the default name.
* `group` can be written as `role` outside of `Togglefy::Feature`
* `environment` can be written as `env` out side of `Togglefy::Feature`

You can check a table for all [Aliases](../aliases) here.

```ruby
Togglefy.for_group(:dev)
Togglefy.for_role(:dev)
Togglefy.for_filters(filters: {group: :dev})
Togglefy.for_filters(filter: {role: :dev})

Togglefy.for_environment(:production)
Togglefy.for_env(:production)
Togglefy.for_filters(filters: {environment: :production})
Togglefy.for_filters(filter: {env: :production})
```
