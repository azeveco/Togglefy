description: Learn how to track usage information from your Features
---

So, you’ve been flipping features on and off like a light switch at a disco — but now you’re wondering:

> "How many people are actually using this shiny new feature I just toggled on?"

Or maybe:

> "Did I toggle something into oblivion and forget about it?"

Fear not — the Analytics module is here to save your (data-driven) soul.

## Tracking a Feature usage data

You can track usage data for a single feature in your system by providing its `Togglefy::Feature` identifier:

```ruby
Togglefy.analytics_for(:teleportation) # :teleportation is the Feature's identifier column
```

This will return an array of hashes, with each hash representing an Assignable in your system (e.g., User, Account, Group, etc.).

Here’s what the result might look like:

```ruby
[
  {
    assignable: "User",
    feature: :teleportation,
    total: 50,
    enabled_count: 20,
    disabled_count: 30,
    percentage_enabled: "40.0%",
    percentage_disabled: "60.0%",
    first_created: 2025-04-21 01:43:28.266664000 UTC +00:00,
    last_created: 2025-05-21 19:18:37.772172000 UTC +00:00,
    past_7: 9,
    past_14: 11,
    past_30: 0
  },
  {
    assignable: "Account",
    feature: :teleportation,
    total: 4,
    enabled_count: 2,
    disabled_count: 0,
    percentage_enabled: "100.0%",
    percentage_disabled: "0.0%",
    first_created: 2025-04-21 01:43:28.266664000 UTC +00:00,
    last_created: 2025-05-21 19:18:37.772172000 UTC +00:00,
    past_7: 2,
    past_14: 0,
    past_30: 0
  }
]
```

So, how you should interpret that data?

Here’s what each field means:

- `assignable`: The model that includes Togglefy::Assignable.
- `feature`: The identifier of the feature being tracked (e.g., `:teleportation`).
- `total`: Total number of assignables in your system.
- `enabled_count`: Number of assignables that have the feature enabled.
- `disabled_count`: Number of assignables that have the feature disabled.
- `percentage_enabled`: Percentage of assignables with the feature enabled.
- `percentage_disabled`: Percentage of assignables with the feature disabled.
- `first_created`: The first time the feature was toggled on for this assignable.
- `last_created`: The most recent time the feature was toggled on for this assignable.
- `past_7`: Number of times the feature was toggled on in the past 7 days.
- `past_14`: Number of times the feature was toggled on in the past 14 days.
- `past_30`: Number of times the feature was toggled on in the past 30 days.
