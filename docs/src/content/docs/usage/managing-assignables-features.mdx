title: Managing Assignables <> Features
description: Learn how to manage the relation between Assignables and Features
---

Now that we know how to create features, let's check how we can manage the relation between the `Assignables` and the `Togglefy::Feature`.

The `Assignable` < > `Feature` relation is held by the `Togglefy::FeatureAssignment` table/model.

## Direct methods

An `assignable` has some direct methods thanks to the `include Togglefy::Assignable`.

These allow you to do operations right from the `assignable` instead of using `Togglefy` methods.

The direct methods are (and let's use an user as an example of an assignable):

```ruby
user.has_feature?(:super_powers) # Checks if user has a single feature
user.add_feature(:super_powers) # Adds a feature to user
user.remove_feature(:super_powers) # Removes a feature from an user
user.clear_features # Clears all features from an user
```

## Using Togglefy

But there's another way to manage Assignables < > Features by using the `FeatureAssignableManager`. It's up to you to decide which one.

But it's important to point that using `Togglefy` is the default, to make sure everything is organized and following a pattern.

Here are the examples:

```ruby
Togglefy.for(assignable).has?(:super_powers) # Checks if assignable (user || account || anything) has a single feature
Togglefy.for(assignable).enable(:super_powers) # Enables/adds a feature to an assignable
Togglefy.for(assignable).disable(:super_powers) # Disables/removes a feature from an assignable
Togglefy.for(assignable).clear # Clears all features from an assignable
```

You can also supercharge it by chaining methods, like:

```ruby
# Instead of doing this:
Togglefy.for(assignable).disable(:alpha_access)
Togglefy.for(assignable).enable(:beta_access)

# You can do something like this:
Togglefy.for(assignable).disable(:alpha_access).enable(:beta_access)
```

### Mass Enable/Disable of Features to/from Assignables
You can mass enable/disable features to/from Assignables.

Doing that is simple! Let's assume that your `Assignable` is an User model.

```ruby
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.enable(:super_powers) # To enable a specific feature to all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.enable([:super_powers, :magic]) # To enable two or more features to all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.enable(:super_powers, percentage: 20) # To enable a feature to 20% of all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.enable([:super_powers, :magic], percentage: 50) # To enable two or more features to 50% of all users
```

The same applies to the disable:

```ruby
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.disable(:super_powers) # To disable a specific feature to all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.disable([:super_powers, :magic]) # To disable two or more features to all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.disable(:super_powers, percentage: 5) # To disable a feature to 5% of all users
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.disable([:super_powers, :magic], percentage: 75) # To disable two or more features to 75% of all users
```

There are a few things to pay attention:
* Whenever you do a enable/disable, it will only query for valid assignables, so:
  * If you do a enable, it will query all assignables that don't have the feature(s) enabled
  * If you do a disable, it will query all assignables that do already have the feature(s) enabled
* You can also use filters for:
  * `group || role`
  * `environment || env`
  * `tenant_id`
  * You can check about filters aliases at [Aliases page](../aliases)

These will be applied to query features that match the identifiers + the filters sent.

So it would be something like:

```ruby
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.enable(:super_powers, group: :admin, percentage: 20)
Togglefy.mass_for(User).bulk.disable(:magic, group: :dev, env: :production, percentage: 75)
```
