To manage `Togglefy::Feature` is the art of create, update, destroy, toggle Features.

## Creating Togglefy::Feature

To create features it's as simple as drinking a nice cold beer after a hard day or drinking the entire bottle of coffee in a span of 1 hour:

```ruby
Togglefy::Feature.create(
  name: "Magic",
  description: "You're a Wizard, Harry"
) # To create a simple Feature
```

If you have tenant, groups (or roles), difference between environments, you can do the following:

```ruby
Togglefy::Feature.create(
  name: "Super Powers",
  description: "With great power comes great responsibility", 
  tenant_id: "123abc",
  group: :admin,
  environment: :production
)
```

You can also use:

```ruby
Togglefy.create(
  name: "Teleportation",
  description: "Allows the assignable to teleport to anywhere",
  group: :jumper
)

# Or

Togglefy.create_feature(
  name: "Teleportation",
  description: "Allows the assignable to teleport to anywhere",
  group: :jumper
)
```

:::note
You don't have to fill all fields, the only one that is mandatory is the name, because is by using the name that we will create the unique identifier, which is the field we'll use to find, delete and more.
:::

:::note
The identifier is the name, downcased and snake_cased üêç
:::

Whenever you create a `Togglefy::Feature`, you can expect something like this:

```ruby
{
  id: 1,
  name: "Super Powers",
  identifier: "super_powers",
  description: "With great power comes great responsibility",
  created_at: "2025-04-12 01:39:10.176561000 +0000",
  updated_at: "2025-04-12 01:39:46.818928000 +0000",
  tenant_id: "123abc",
  group: "admin",
  environment: "production",
  status: "inactive"
}
```

## Updating Togglefy::Feature

To update a feature is as simple as riding on a monocycle while balancing a cup of water on the top of a really tall person that's on your shoulders.

Here's how you can do it:

```ruby
Togglefy.update(:super_powers, tenant_id: "abc123")
Togglefy.update_feature(:super_powers, tenant_id: "abc123")
```

Or by finding the feature manually and then updating it like you always do with Rails:

```ruby
feature = Togglefy::Feature.find_by(identifier: :super_powers)
# or
feature = Togglefy.feature(:super_powers) # This is explained more in the "Finding a specific feature" section of this README

feature.update(tenant_id: "123abc")
```

## Destroying Togglefy::Feature

It looks like you're mean üòà. Do you want to cause destruction?

Well... we, the contributors, have nothing to do with this, so here's how you can destroy a feature:

```ruby
Togglefy.destroy(:super_powers)
Togglefy.destroy_feature(:super_powers)
Togglefy::Feature.identifier(:super_powers).destroy
Togglefy::Feature.find_by(identifier: :super_powers).destroy
```

## Toggle Togglefy::Feature status

You can toggle a feature status between active and inactive by doing this:

```ruby
Togglefy.toggle(:super_powers)
Togglefy.toggle_feature(:super_powers)
```

## About Togglefy::Feature status

As you can see, the `Togglefy::Feature` also has a status and it is default to `inactive`. You can change this during creation.

The status of a `Togglefy::Feature` should not be interpreted as if the Assignable has the feature.

The status holds the `inactive` or `active` values. This status is not to define if an Assignable (any model that has the `include Togglefy::Assignable`) either has or doesn't have a feature, but to decide if this feature is available system/application-wide.

It's up to you to define how you will implement it:
* Is it inactive? Then this feature is likely unreleased
* Or maybe if it is inactive, it means that the feature is unavailable for some reason? Maintenance? 

Again, it's up to you!

The `status` can be:

```ruby
:inactive || "inactive" || 0
:active || "active" || 1
```

You can change the status by:
* Sending a value during creation
* Updating the column
* Doing a:
  ```ruby
  Togglefy::Feature.find_by(identifier: :super_powers).active!
  Togglefy.feature(:super_powers).active!
  Togglefy.active!(:super_powers)
  Togglefy.activate_feature(:super_powers)

  Togglefy::Feature.find_by(identifier: :super_powers).inactive!
  Togglefy.feature(:super_powers).inactive!
  Togglefy.inactive!(:super_powers)
  Togglefy.inactivate_feature(:super_powers)
  ```
